## python cool compiler

COOL is the Classroom Object Oriented Language. I'm going to get at least partway through writing a compiler for it. I've written a regular expression parser, then used that to write a lexical analyzer. Now I need to write a few more definitions for lexemes and work on constructing an abstract syntax tree

This is what the lexical analyzer looks like now
